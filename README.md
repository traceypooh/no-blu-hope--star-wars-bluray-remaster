# no-blu-hope--star-wars-bluray-remaster
lossless reedit of Star Wars bluray disc to 1977 version of film

## Background
The bluray release of the first film was part of a $10M restoration project of the updated 1977 version of the film.
The Lucas teams used multiple "cans" (reels) of film from various sources, un-spliced the negatives and split into various film stock groups, to irreversibly, chemically restore the cells as best they could.
The results are *spectacular*.
In addition, they split out the 2-channel stereo to 6.1 DTS lossless audio, also done extremely well.

## Philosophy for this Project / Repository
_.. then what's my (and most everyone's) problem?_
As is well-known, they added many previously deleted scenes (eg: Biggs and Luke talking before flying off against Death Star) and enhanced some (eg: Jabba the Hutt goes from large human actor to CG "lizard") and more.  Much of the effects are very distracting and anachronistic to the stark beauty of the "small environments" and beautiful practical effects used in 1977.

## Guidelines:
* remove added and heavily edited scenes
* remove edits like Greedo even getting a shot off (spoiler alert: no blasts are seen in 1977 -- Han shoots under the table with _almost_ no warning)
* otherwise keep the restored video, _losslessly_
* keep the cleaned audio, again _losslessly_
* where some more minor edits happened (eg: updated halo/ring around explosions) that dont significantly alter the feel of the film, allow/keep them.

## work in progress -- STAY TUNED!
* _all the removed CG is done_
* _all the replaced scenes are done tested_
* _just need to assemble them all into single big file and test!_
* _... then I have to fight my PS3 8-)_

See the [run.sh](run.sh) script for the *details!*
